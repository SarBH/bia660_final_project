Braven:

The Challenge

In America, we’ve promised that hard work and ambition will be met with equality of opportunity. The reality is that we have a quiet crisis on our hands. Before COVID-19, an African American with a BA was twice as likely to be unemployed as their white counterpart, and a Bachelor’s degree holder from a low-income background started their career earning only two-thirds as much as those from higher-income backgrounds. While education has the potential to be the great equalizer, only 25% of our country’s 1.2 million first-generation or low-income college enrollees are predicted to land a strong job after graduation and be on a path to the American Dream. And with the COVID-19 crisis upon us, now more than ever, college students from humble beginnings need to be prepared to compete for strong jobs.


Our Vision

We believe that our country’s next generation of leaders will emerge from everywhere, but they need a talent strategy that matches them in strength and diversity. We envision an American Dream Team—100,000 diverse leaders-in-the-making—prepared to access and thrive in strong first jobs after college graduation.


Theory of Action

Braven supports untapped students from college to career by partnering with universities, employers, and college success organizations to offer a two-part experience that begins with a credit-bearing college course followed by a post-course experience that lasts through graduation. Fellows emerge from Braven with the skills, experiences and networks they need to land a strong first job and get on a path to economic freedom. Braven has worked with more than 2,300 students at four campuses at Rutgers University-Newark, San José State, Lehman College, and National Louis University to date.


Outcomes

Braven Fellows across the country are persisting in college and achieving exciting levels of internship and job attainment.


95% of our Fellows are persisting in or have graduated from college.
73% of Braven college graduates have at least one internship during college, compared with 49% of first-generation seniors at large state universities, and Braven Fellows outpace the national average for strong job attainment.


Within six months of graduation, 71% of Fellows secured quality full-time jobs worthy of their Bachelor’s degree or enrolled in graduate school, compared to 56% of all students and 49% of students from similar backgrounds.


We believe Braven is a solution and we are on a mission to scale it, equalizing access to the American Dream.


The Role

The Manager of Employer Partnership Data & Operations will be responsible for collaboratively designing, implementing, and improving systems that help a mission-driven organization and its diverse stakeholders get farther, faster. You’ll be a fit for the role if you love finding problems, solving puzzles, and creating process improvements, and you have a deep customer service orientation.


At Braven, employer partnerships fuel Fellow outcomes, support our organization’s growth, and contribute to our fiscal sustainability. To take our work to new heights, we’re looking for somebody who believes deeply in the value of strong systems that scale impact. You’ll be responsible for creating both systems and communications that meet the needs of a wide set of stakeholders, including volunteers, Fellows, employer partners, and staff members ranging from program managers to executive directors. With that in mind, you’ll need to excel at cross-functional collaboration, work well in teams, understand staff and user experiences, use data to inform decisions, and communicate effectively to both staff and external stakeholders.


Responsibilities

Quickly understand Braven’s programs, data systems, and communications in order to lead projects starting in January
Achieve pipeline goals for employer partnerships: recruiting volunteers, sourcing job and internship opportunities, and organizing employer-led engagements
Own a systems redesign of volunteer recruitment registration forms, website pages, automated email communications, and staff-facing dashboards
Create compelling marketing materials and email templates that ladder up to the org-wide employer partnership strategy
Translate bi-directionally between users and engineers, helping tech and data teams understand user needs, and helping users understand newly developed tech tools
Analyze data and make inferences using a variety of sources both quantitative (e.g user engagement data) and qualitative (e.g. empathy research)
Provide excellent customer service by training staff, creating high user engagement, and troubleshooting volunteer, employer partner, and staff needs as they arise
Assist with operations for events with employer partners as needed


To be successful at Braven during this phase of growth, on the External Affairs team, and in this role, you must demonstrate Braven’s core values, skillfully navigate ambiguity and ongoing change, approach problems with curiosity and agency, and welcome constant feedback and learning. You will thrive if you can quickly jump into the Braven context, adapt to unexpected changes, love taking on new challenges, and can get yourself unstuck. You will need to take initiative and find a way when clear structures, systems, processes, and expectations are not well-defined. You must have a high degree of self-ownership, a team and mission-driven orientation, a low degree of ego, and a high degree of grace. This kind of work is not for everyone but if it’s for you, this is a fantastic team of awesome humans and incredibly meaningful work to be a part of. Come join us in shaping the next generation of leaders!


Experiences, Skills, and Traits

At least 3-5 years of work experience; BA or equivalent degree
High degree of technological savvy as a user; experience with customer relationship management and email marketing software preferred (e.g. Salesforce and Mailchimp); experience with agile methodology is also a plus

Cultural competence and experience working with diverse populations (both students and professionals) preferred; operate with an asset-based lens
Customer-service orientation
Learns quickly and manages large volumes of feedback on a regular basis


Total Rewards Philosophy

Braven is committed to attracting and retaining extraordinary, diverse leaders who believe deeply in our mission and uphold our core values as organizational leaders and stewards within and outside of the organization. Braven provides a “total rewards package” that encompasses comprehensive and competitive benefits, compensation, recognition, and career development. Current benefits include: Braven covers 85% of health care costs, has unlimited vacation time, matches up to 5% of your 401K contribution starting your first full month, a paid sabbatical after 4 years on staff, and competitive base salaries based on the midpoint of the market among not-for-profit organizations of similar size. We believe in compensating staff members fairly in relation to each other, their qualifications, and their impact on behalf of the organization and take internal equity seriously. Staff who are meeting expectations generally receive an annual 3% increase. Braven conducts benchmarking every other year; based on this external data, some salaries may also receive market adjustments to keep pace with relevant competition in similar roles. Braven reserves the right to change benefits at any time.


The salary for this position depends on your prior work experience. Please be advised, you will have an opportunity to discuss salary in more detail after you begin the application process.
